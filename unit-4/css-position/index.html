    <div class="static">
        <h1>Static</h1>
        static is the default value. An element that is positioned static; is not positioned in any special way.
    </div>

    <div class="relative1">
        <h1>Relative</h1>
        Relative behaves the same as static unless you add some extra properties like <i>top, right, bottom, left</i> 
    </div>
    
    <div class="fixed">
    A <b>fixed</b> element is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the same place EVEN if the page is scrolled. As with relative, the top, right, bottom, and left properties are used.
    </div>


    <h2>position: absolute;</h2>

    <p>An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed):</p>

    <div class="relative">
        This div element has position: relative;

        <div class="absolute">
            This div element has position: absolute;
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
